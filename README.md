# pugBot.tf

This is the website source code for [pugBot.tf](https://pugbot.tf). It is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) in SSR mode and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for certain reactive components.

You can find the bot's source code [here.](https://github.com/Ooglely/pugBot)

## Notes

This was my first project using both Astro and Svelte.

To-do list:
- [ ] Leaderboard/Stats
- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Bot documentation
